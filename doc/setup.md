Run `setup.py`
==============

Create a user that will own the loris application, e.g.:

```
$ adduser loris
```

This user needs to have a home directory (unless you want to override it in the WSGI [`home=` directive](https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives#WSGIDaemonProcess)) and the user and group name should match the `run_as_user` and `run_as_group` options of in the `[loris.Loris]` section of `loris2.conf` and the `--loris-owner` and `--loris-group` options that you pass to `setup.py` (see beloq)..

Finally, from the `loris` (not `loris/loris`) directory, either as root or with `sudo` run `./setup.py install` with the options of your choice.

There are a bunch of flag that can be passed to `setup.py install` to customize where things wind up. Assuming you run `setup.py` with appropriate permissions (probably root), the script will make any directories that don't exist and set the ownership and permissions appropriately.

These are the options (they can also be viewed by executing `python setup.py install --help`):

```
 --kdu-expand      Path to the Kakadu executable [Default: /usr/local/bin/kdu_expand]
 --libkdu          Path to __the directory that contains__ libkdu.so [Default: /usr/local/lib]
 --image-cache     Path to image cache directory [Default: /var/cache/loris2]
 --tmp-dir         Path to temporary directory (loris will make its temporary files and pipes here) [Default: /tmp/loris2]
 --www-dir         Path to www directory (wsgi and index file will be here) [Default: /var/www/loris2]
 --log-dir         Path to directory for logs [Default: /var/log/loris2]
 --source-images   Path to source images directory [Default: /usr/local/share/images]
 --config-dir      Where to put the config file. loris2.conf will be here after install. [Default: /etc/loris2]
 --info-cache      Path to info cache directory [Default: /var/cache/loris2]
 --loris-owner     User that will own the application and has permission to write to caches. [Default: loris]
 --loris-group     Group that will own the application and has permission to write to caches. [Default: loris]
```

All of these will be updated in the config file during deployment.

Note that again that __Kakadu is no longer installed__ by the setup script; it didn't work for too many people. You may use the copy that is bundled with Loris, provided you comply with the [terms outlined by NewSouth Innovations](http://www.kakadusoftware.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=22) and this version works on your system. Either of these may well not be the case, in which case you will need to obtain a copy of Kakadu 7+ separately and may need to compile it for your system.
