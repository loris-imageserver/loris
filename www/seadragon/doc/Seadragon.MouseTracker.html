    <h1>Seadragon.MouseTracker class</h1>
    <h4>Version 0.8.9 - Back to <a href="./">Seadragon Ajax Library</a></h4>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        A utility class that abstracts away the complexity of a proper mouse-tracking state
        machine. Registers mouse event listeners on an element, and invokes user-set handlers
        for useful mouse events. Also uses custom thresholds for clicks to differentiate
        them from drags and holds more precisely.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>
        All handler properties except target are user-defined functions that are
        invoked by this class. Setting a handler means that it will get invoked
        on the next corresponding event. All handlers are passed at least two
        arguments: the MouseTracker instance that invoked the handler, and the
        position of the mouse, relative to the target element, as a
        <a href="Seadragon.Point.html" title="Seadragon.Point class">Seadragon.Point</a>.
        All handlers are initially null.

                regular "mouseup" events, this is also always triggered when the

                that at least one of <em>insideElmtPress</em> and

    <h2>Example Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The following code allows a chess piece to be dragged and dropped on a
        chess board.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        var tracker = new Seadragon.MouseTracker(piece);
        var location = null;
        
        tracker.pressHandler = function(tracker, position) {
            piece.pickUp();     // draw piece bigger, add shadow, etc.
            location = new Seadragon.Point(
                    parseInt(piece.style.left),
                    parseInt(piece.style.top)
            );  // remember where piece was originally drawn
        };
        
        tracker.dragHandler = function(tracker, position, delta, shift) {
            location = location.plus(delta);
            piece.style.left = location.x + "px";
            piece.style.top = location.y + "px";
        };
        
        tracker.releaseHandler = function(tracker, position, insideElmtPress, insideElmtRelease) {
            if (!insideElmtPress) {
                return;         // ignore releases from outside
            }
            
            piece.putDown();    // draw piece smaller, remove shadow, etc.
            location = null;
        };
        
        tracker.setTracking(true);  // begin tracking
    </p>
    <p>
        The following code toggles a button between a regular state, a hover
        state, and a pressed state. It only goes to hover when the mouse is over
        the button and the mouse button is up.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        var tracker = new Seadragon.MouseTracker(button);
        
        tracker.enterHandler = function(tracker, position, buttonDownElmt, buttonDownAny) {

                button.goToPressedState();
            } else if (buttonDownAny) {
                // the mouse is down from elsewhere, stay in normal state
                return;
            } else {
                // the mouse is up
                button.goToHoverState();

        tracker.exitHandler = function(tracker, position, buttonDownElmt, buttonDownAny) {
            // always go to normal state
            button.goToNormalState();

                button.doAction();
            } else {

                // the mouse was pressed elsewhere and released inside the button.
                // we didn't go to hover when the mouse entered since the mouse was down,
